# Activate this profile to enable TLS and HTTP/2.
#
# JHipster has generated a self-signed certificate, which will be used to encrypt traffic.
# As your browser will not understand this certificate, you will need to import it.
#
# Another (easiest) solution with Chrome is to enable the "allow-insecure-localhost" flag
# at chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
